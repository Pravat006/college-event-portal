ADMIN ROUTE PROTECTION VERIFICATION:

1. Admin Layout Protection (/src/app/admin/layout.tsx):
   - Uses requireAdmin() function to check user role
   - Redirects to home page (/) if user is not admin
   - Wraps all admin routes as children

2. Individual Admin Pages:
   - /admin/page.tsx (Admin Dashboard)
   - /admin/events/page.tsx (Event Management)
   - /admin/users/page.tsx (User Management) 
   - /admin/registrations/page.tsx (Registration Management)
   - /admin/analytics/page.tsx (Analytics Dashboard)
   - All use requireAdmin() and redirect on error

3. requireAdmin() Function (/src/lib/auth.ts):
   - First calls requireAuth() to ensure user is authenticated
   - Then checks if user.role === 'ADMIN'
   - Throws error if not admin, causing redirect

4. Middleware Protection (/src/middleware.ts):
   - Uses Clerk middleware to protect routes
   - Admin routes not explicitly excluded from auth

5. Role-based Redirection (/src/app/auth-redirect/page.tsx):
   - Checks user role via /api/auth/check-user
   - Redirects admins to /admin
   - Redirects users to /dashboard

HOW PROTECTION WORKS:
- Non-admin users trying to access /admin/* routes will be caught by requireAdmin()
- The function throws an error which triggers the catch block
- Catch block uses redirect("/") to send user to home page
- Layout-level protection means ALL admin subroutes are protected

TESTING SCENARIOS:
1. Anonymous user tries to access /admin → Clerk middleware redirects to sign-in
2. Authenticated USER role tries to access /admin → requireAdmin() throws error → redirect("/")
3. Authenticated ADMIN role accesses /admin → Success, admin dashboard loads

PROTECTION LAYERS:
1. Clerk Authentication (middleware)
2. User Database Check (requireAuth)
3. Role Verification (requireAdmin)
4. Layout-level Protection (admin/layout.tsx)
5. Page-level Protection (individual admin pages)
