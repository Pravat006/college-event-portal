# Event Registration Component Production Deployment Guide

This document provides specific guidance for deploying and maintaining the event registration functionality in the College Event Portal.

## Key Components

1. **`event-registration-button.tsx`**: Button component that handles registration UI states
2. **`event-registration-form.tsx`**: Form component for collecting registration information
3. **`/api/events/register`**: API route for processing registrations

## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set in your Vercel project settings:

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL`: The production URL of your application (e.g., https://college-events.example.com)
- `RESEND_API_KEY`: Valid API key for the Resend email service
- `DATABASE_URL`: Production database connection string

### Email Sending Configuration

For email confirmations to work properly in production:

1. Verify your domain with Resend (https://resend.com/domains)
2. Update the `from` email address in `src/lib/email.ts` to use your verified domain
3. Test email delivery before full deployment

## Performance Optimizations

The registration button component includes these production optimizations:

- Component memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Error handling for navigation failures
- Loading states for better user feedback
- Graceful fallbacks for network issues

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Common Registration Issues

1. **Email Delivery Problems**:
   - Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
   - Verify sender domain is properly verified
   - Check spam filters on recipient side

2. **Database Connection Errors**:
   - Verify connection string is correct
   - Check database server status
   - Monitor connection pool usage

3. **API Rate Limiting**:
   - Implement appropriate caching strategies
   - Add retry logic for transient failures

### Log Analysis

Monitor these specific log patterns for registration issues:

```
"Registration API error:"  - Indicates API request failures
"Failed to send confirmation email:" - Email sending issues
"Navigation error:" - Client-side routing problems
```

## Security Considerations

1. Ensure proper input validation on both client and server
2. Implement rate limiting for registration endpoints
3. Set appropriate CORS policies
4. Keep dependencies updated with `npm audit` and regular updates

## Scaling Considerations

If your event portal grows to support many concurrent registrations:

1. Consider implementing a queue system for high-volume events
2. Add database indexing for frequently queried fields
3. Implement caching for event data that doesn't change frequently
4. Consider serverless function warm-up strategies for consistent performance

## Maintenance Tasks

- Regularly check for outdated dependencies with `npm outdated`
- Monitor email delivery rates and spam reputation
- Review error logs for registration failures
- Test the registration flow after major updates
